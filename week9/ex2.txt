To increase (maximize Hit rate, minimize Miss rate),
we can request the same page reference multiple consecutive times.
Example: 1 1 1 1 1 1 -> 5 hits, 1 miss

To decrease (minimize Hit rate, maximize Miss rate)
we can request many different references with small repetitions as possible.
Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 -> 0 hits, 6 misses


example from ex1:

Hit rate 375
Miss rate 625
